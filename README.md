:bear::bear: **Note 1:** Also, see [Ilya Kostrikov's JAX implementation of DroQ](https://github.com/ikostrikov/walk_in_the_park), which is so much faster than my implementation! :bear::bear:

:rocket::rocket: **Note 2:** DroQ is now implemented in [Stable Baselines Jax](https://github.com/araffin/sbx), which is also much faster than my implementation!! :rocket::rocket:

:sheep::sheep:**Note 3:** DroQ is implemented in [SheepRL](https://github.com/Eclectic-Sheep/sheeprl)!!! :sheep::sheep:

:musical_keyboard::musical_keyboard: **Note 4:** DroQ is used in [RoboPianist](https://kzakka.com/robopianist/). It can learn to play Mario Bros. music ([Main theme](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wXDPTDfOuA_rG6GMwv7NJcELxc9gUOc-/view?usp=drive_link) and [Rawest forest](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IZCdQ38g6FCXqvwZyxGpvgjTQKohzXX2/view?usp=drive_link)), The Legend of Zelda music ([Main theme](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E2dnue0rSecbpVvyFcd6uO4jrGnik3Mx/view?usp=drive_link) and [Song of storms](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yUjAmf9vspt5_J8H0aZsrAEH6CZ6IP-S/view?usp=drive_link)), Pokemon BW music ([VS Rival](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hxfCCKGPEGJQtqWIGLz40PyTqTFdPCmG/view?usp=share_link)), Chrono Trigger music ([Wind Scene](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FMIOoKWpjdiITdnySSK7784ckNrJbR6P/view?usp=drive_link)), Maple story music ([Login theme](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17i8drpYYCZV3Rq-NslGWUJkLdcbSesF8/view?usp=drive_link)), Evangelion song ([Komm, s√ºsser Tod](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QBdLN39EkGamiMcicb4h-8N5LIKfRtfQ/view?usp=drive_link)), and Ado's song ([Show](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pe4N-DwPQeYnGDoOvxJ_dgPz39j3ivrR/view?usp=drive_link)) in 400k samples!!!! :musical_keyboard::musical_keyboard:

# Requirements
You can install libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt` except `mujoco_py`.

Note that you need a licence to install `mujoco_py`. For installation, please follow instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py).

# How to use?
## First, you need to choose codebase:
If you want to use agents implemented on the top of [KU codebase](https://github.com/ku2482/soft-actor-critic.pytorch). 
```
cd KUCodebase/code
```
If you want to use agents implemented on the top of [REDQ original codebase](https://github.com/watchernyu/REDQ), 
```
cd OriginalREDQCodebase
```


## Then, you can train agents as following examples.
### SAC agent
```
python main.py -info sac -env Hopper-v2 -seed 0 -eval_every 1000 -frames 100000 -eval_runs 10  -gpu_id 0 -updates_per_step 20 -method sac -target_entropy -1.0 
```

### REDQ agent
```
python main.py -info redq -env Hopper-v2 -seed 0 -eval_every 1000 -frames 100000 -eval_runs 10 -gpu_id 0 -updates_per_step 20 -method redq -target_entropy -1.0
```

### DroQ agent (also called Dr.Q agent in the first version of my Arxiv and ICLR papers)
```
python main.py -info drq -env Hopper-v2 -seed 0 -eval_every 1000 -frames 100000 -eval_runs 10 -gpu_id 7 -updates_per_step 20 -method sac -target_entropy -1.0 -target_drop_rate 0.005 -layer_norm 1
```

# Results

The experimental results (records of returns and estimation errors) are created under ``runs'' directory.

# Tips

## Hyperparameter sensitivity of DroQ

DroQ is sensitive especially to target entropy (target_entropy) and (target_drop_rate). 

If you use KU codebase, you can reproduce the results of my paper by setting target_entropy and target_drop_rate as follows.
|Environment| target_entropy | target_dropout_rate |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Hopper    | -1.0           | 0.01                | 
| Walker2d  | -3.0           | 0.01                | 
| Ant       | -4.0           | 0.01                | 
| Humanoid  | -2.0           | 0.01                | 

If you use REDQ original codebase, you can reproduce the results of my paper by setting target_drop_rate as follows (**the value for target entropy is automatically assigned in core.py**). 
|Environment| target_dropout_rate |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| Hopper    | 0.0001              | 
| Walker2d  | 0.005               | 
| Ant       | 0.01                | 
| Humanoid  | 0.1                 | 

Overall, methods implemented on REDQ original codebase work better than KU codebase counterparts. 
**Upper figures show performance on KU codebase. Bottom figures show performance on REDQ original codebase.**

See Figures 2 and 14 in [my paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xCVJMsPv3RT) for details. 

## What if we want a very sample-efficient one by ignoring computational efficiency?
Introduce layer normalization into REDQ with a large ensemble size (Dropout is not necessary in this case).
See Figures 12 and 20 in [my paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xCVJMsPv3RT) for details. 

# The limitations of DroQ 
**Need to tune the dropout rate.** The DroQ performance is highly dependent on the dropout rate (Figures 4 and 16 in [my paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xCVJMsPv3RT)), and additional samples are needed for its tuning. 
Introducing hyperparameter-free automatic tuning of dropout rate is future work. 

**Use of high UTD ratio.** DroQ uses a high UTD ratio (frequent update of Q-networks), which is a current bottleneck in computation speed. 
Reducing the UTD ratio without compromising sample and memory efficiency is future work.
Using multi-step returns and high learning rates would be a promising way for this??
